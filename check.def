The value of Rint is greater than 0.12 ......... $F

 The value of Rint (i.e. _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents) should normally be
 considerably less than 0.12 and in the order of magnitude of the reported
 R-values. Rint may be relatively meaningless when based on a very limited
 number of averaged data. Higher values should be accompanied by a suitable
 explanation in the _publ_section_exptl_refinement section. However,
 authors should first ensure that there are not overlooked problems
 associated with the data or the space-group. Elevated values for 
 _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents may be indicative of a need to recollect 
 the data from a crystal of higher quality or that there is a problem with
 the data treatment. Consider the following:
 (a) The absorption corrections are inadequate or inappropriate.
 (b) The overall quality of the data may be poor due to the crystal quality.
 (c) The crystal is very weakly diffracting, so that a large proportion of
     essentially "unobserved" reflections are being used in the refinement.
     You should consider using a better crystal or a data collection at
     low temperature and/or, if the compound is organic, using Cu radiation.
 (d) You are working in the wrong crystal system or Laue group.
 (e) You have only a very small number of equivalent reflections, which
     may lead to artificially high values of _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents 

 Note that if _diffrn_reflns_av_sigmaI/netI is also large, the quality
 of the data should be considered to be suspect.

 The expected number of reflections corresponds to that in the asymmetric
 unit of the Laue group. Expected ratio: less-or-equal 1 for centro symmetric
 structures and less than 2 for non-centrosymmetric structures.
 Reasons to exceed those numbers can be:
  1 - Systematic extinctions not omitted from the observed data count.

 Ideally (and a requirement for publication in Acta Crystallographica),

 -diffrn-measured-fraction-theta-full (close to 1.0), up to 
 sin(theta)/lambda = 0.6 (i.e. 25.24 degrees MoKa).       
 The three major causes of incomplete data sets are:
 1 - A missing cusp of data due to data collection by rotation around
     the spindle axis only (standard on some image-plate systems).
     Cure: collect an additional data set after remounting the crystal.
 2 - The DENZO image processing package has problems with certain strong
     reflections. They are often excluded from the data set.
     Cure: Add an additional scan at lower power setting in order to
     include strong low order reflections.
 3 - Incomplete scans.

 to sin(theta/lambda) = 0.6 (i.e. 25.24 degrees for MoKa and 67.7 degrees
 for CuKa  radiation).
 The three major causes of incomplete data sets are:

     Cure: collect an additional data set after remounting the crystal.
 2 - The DENZO imageprocessing package has problems with certain strong

     Cure: Add an additional scan at lower power setting in order to

 3 - Incomplete scans, possibly based on erroneously assumed higher than
     actual symmetry.

 Note: The default value of _diffrn_measured_fraction_theta_full that
 is automatically calculated and inserted in the CIF by SHELXL-97 might
 generate A-level ALERTS when significant numbers of reflections are 
 missing at higher theta values. In order to avoid such an ALERT,
 substitute the values calculated with the SHELXL instruction 'ACTA 50'
 for _diffrn_reflns_theta_full and _diffrn_measured_fraction_theta_full
 respectively. For Mo-radiation, corresponding values of 25 degees (or
 higher) and 0.99 (or higher) are expected. (See SHELXL manual).
 PLATON may be used to analyse the case at hand (by invoking either the
 'FCF-VALIDATION' mode or the 'ASYM-VIEW' mode).

 This test checks whether a refined extinction parameter is meaningful
 i.e. whether its value is significantly larger than its corresponding s.u.
 If not, this parameter should be removed from the model and the structure
 refined without this meaningless additional parameter.
 The current default gives a warning when its value is within 3.33 s.u.
 SHELXL97-2 will not allow negative values leading to ill-convergence and
 non-zero maximum shift/error values: remove extinction parameter from the

 Check the validity of the absolute structure determination.
 A high su indicates that the experimental data do not support the
 determination of the absolute structure. This will generally be the case
 with light atom MoKa data where f" is nearly zero.

 Note: Use the TWIN & BASF 0.0 instructions in SHELXL97. The default 
 FLACK parameter is not always reliable, in particular when strongly 
 correlated with the position of the origin (e.g. along y in space-group P21). 

 Please refer to Flack,H.D. & Bernardinelli, G. (1999) Acta Cryst. A55,

 A value of the Flack parameter that deviates significantly from zero
 (taking into account the associated s.u.) might indicate that the
 absolute structure should be inverted in case of a value closer to 1.0
 than to zero. A value close to 0.5 may be indicative of an inversion
 twin or a missed centre of inversion. 

 For valid absolute structure assignments, abs(x) should be less than
 2 * s.u., with su < 0.04. For enantiopure compounds, s.u. should be less
 than 0.1.

 You have indicated that an absorption correction has not been applied.
 (_exptl_absorpt_correction_type 'none'). However, the predicted values of
 Tmin & Tmax, based on the crystal dimensions given in the CIF, are 
 sufficiently unequal that absorption effects appear to be significant.
 Therefore, the application of a suitable absorption correction would
 appear to be required. Also check that the crystal dimensions given in the
 CIF do represent the actual crystal dimensions as closely as possible.
 Inaccuracies here can lead to a poor prediction of Tmin & Tmax and give
 rise to these alerts. It should normally be possible to estimate the 
 crystal dimensions to 2 decimal places. Rough estimates to only 1 decimal
 place may be too inaccurate to provide reliable estimates of Tmin & Tmax.

 The official definition calls for 'The effective number of electrons in the

 contributions and is calculated as:

 F(000) = [ (sum f~r~)^2^ + (sum f~i~)^2^ ]^1/2^

 The CIF contains an atom sitting on a special position with occupancy
 specified as less than 1.0. This is often an error and the result of the
 confusion of the notions 'occupancy' and 'population parameter'. The first
 should be 1.0 for a fully occupied site. The latter multiplies the
 site-symmetry with the occupancy. Thus, for a fully occupied site on a
 mirror plane the site-symmetry will be 0.5 * 1.0 = 0.5.

 Optionally specify the Hall symbol. The Hall symbol provides an
 unambiguous definition of the space-group symmetry where the Hermann-
 Mauguin symbol leaves room for alternative choices of the origin.
 E.g. for space-group P21, the screw axis is in general taken to coincide 
 with the b-axis. However, sometimes it is chosen to be shifted by 1/4
 in the c-axis direction to bring out the relation with P21/c. The Hall
 symbols will be 'P 2yb' and 'P 2ybc' respectively.

 the sum of the associated van der Waals Radii. More often than not, such  
 short contacts can be a warning sign for errors. All short contacts should 
 therefore be examined in some detail. Interesting exceptions are carbonyl-
 carbonyl interactions that often feature short O...C contacts (see Allen 
 et al. (1998) B54, 320-329, short NO2 O...O interactions and BF4(-) to

 Crystal structures in general do not contain large solvent accessible voids
 in the lattice. Most structures lose their long-range ordering when solvent
 molecules leave the crystal. Only when the remaining network is strongly
 bonded (e.g. zeolites and some hydrogen bonded networks) the crystal 
 structure may survive.
 Residual voids in a structure may indicate the omission of (disordered) 
 density from the model. Disordered density may go undetected when smeared
 since peak search programs are not designed to locate maxima on density
 ridges. The presence or absence of residual density in the void may be
 verified on a printed/plotted difference Fourier map or with PLATON/SQUEEZE.
 Voids of 40 Ang**3 may accommodate H2O. Small molecules such as 
 Tetrahydrofuran have typical volumes in the 100 to 200 Ang**3 range.
 This test reports the volume of the largest solvent accessible void in the
 structure.
 A paper reporting a crystal structure with a significant solvent accessible

 operations are needed to get atoms in a bonding position. A connected set of
 atoms is not needed for the least squares refinement (unless hydrogen atoms
 are to be added at calculated positions). Geometry listings (bonds, angles,

 Unless for a good reason, molecular species should be transformed
 (by symmetry and/or translation) so that their centres of gravity
 are close to or within the unit-cell bounds. This is a strict rule for the
 main species. Deviations from this general rule are for smaller additional
 species when relevant for intermolecular interactions with the main species.
